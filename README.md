# Hoop Stats

The goal of Hoop Stats aims to eliminate the need for pen-and-paper when it comes to recording basketball statistics.<br />
By implementing a two-tap method, users can now easily record player activities as never before.<br />
All data will be securely saved in Cloud Firestore so you can access it anytime and anywhere.
